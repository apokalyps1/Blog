        <h2>A cure for bigotry</h2>
        <p>Just to preface, I'm not an authority on anything, and I don't want to pretend to be this is more of a brain dump of ideas that pop into my head than anything else that said "on with the show":
          
          I think a lot about existence, some might call me an existentialist, although I don't really like that because it implies a Nietzsche-esque nihilism and I definitely wouldn't classify it as that. I feel as if existentialism and awe at the beauty of life can go hand in hand, you don't have to be pessimistic about life to think about it.

          In his short story <u><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17563539-the-egg">"The Egg"</a></u> Andy Weir tells the story of a man who dies and goes to the afterlife, in this afterlife he meets a god who tells him that he is a growing god (an egg if you will) and that every time he dies he is reincarnated as yet another person, the story ends on the revelation that everyone who has ever lived or will ever live is an incarnation of the same person. It's an amazing short story and my description of it does it so little justice that it's like calling a cake "solidified mixed grain and egg" so I would strongly suggest you check it out in some form. However, what Weir is exploring here is the concept of Open Individualism, the idea that there is no "self" but rather everyone and everything is the same, and it's an interesting thought to play around with, not least for its consequences on our individual actions.

          Personally I don't really believe in open individualism, not least because it often devolves into egotistical pseudo-intellecutallistic bullshit, but I do think that some interpretations of it can be interesting when thinking about morality, I mean would you treat other people the same if you knew that they were just an incarnation of yourself? It's an idea that takes the phrase "put yourself in someone else's shoes" literally, and can lead to a slight change in how we view others and that can in turn help us to be more compassionate, pessimistically speaking it's a self-beneficial view of morality. However, I think it also brings a very interesting sympathy, one that sees everyone as equal and encourages a view of everyone as a product of their surroundings, just as we all do shitty things we regret while thinking they're good at the time, so too do other people, but maybe they haven't had the realization that they are wrong yet, and maybe they never will.
          <h3>What does all of this Random Word vomit mean (tldr)</h3>
          In general through seeing everyone as being a product of their surroundings and upbringings and as equally human as we are, we are able to provide a lifeline to the worst facets of society, to help them overcome their bigotry, we stop bundling them into a group of "disgustingly backwards others" and instead we understand that their lack of perspective is not incurable but rather a disease that can be solved through understanding them. We can cure deeply rooted bias and bigotry though education and outreach we provide a potent cure for such diseases as Racism, Homophobia and Transphobia.
          
          And this works both in more specific examples such as Daryl Davis a black musician who has converted over 200 KKK members by trying to understand why they are the way they are and gets to the root of their bigotry and then meeting with them human to human and looking for similarities between them, but also in more abstract ones, like the thousands of parents of LGBTQ+ children who have been forced to look inward and address their own misconceptions and bigotries though humanisation.
          
          So next time you are annoyed at someone, or standing at a moral crossroad try open individualism it might just make the world a better place.
