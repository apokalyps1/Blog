        <h2>What is the purpose of this blog?</h2>
        <p>
        First, I want to thank you for taking the time to read this blog, and if you are close to me, you probably know the answer to the title allready - wether through my own mouth or how i act. I think of too much stupid stuff.

        The reason that I set up this blog is twofold:
        Firstly, I kind of want a creative outlet, a place for collecting my thoughts and practicing expressing and explaining them in a way that is entertaining, lighthearted, ect. knowing that that is something that I am not very good at, expressing my thoughts in a neat and tidy way.
        Secondly, I have a lot of things to say, to the point where I struggle to stop talking and listen sometimes because I have this irrational anxiety that often things in my head need to be said lest they sit within my head and decay themselves to death going completely unsaid. And that's probably not socially helpful, and I'd imagine my freinds often despise me for that.
        
        The working title of this blog is "Between Conversations" and I think that is an aptly descriptive title, as this is most likely where I am going to put many of the things that I feel fall "between conversations" ideas wether personal or otherwise.

        What I will try to do with this blog when talking about ideas close to myself I will keep everything generalised, I will definately never use any names of people as that is unfair and, as I will likely discuss at one point, individual responsibility is a strange concept and people are different from their actions, no person is infallible and no action of a person defines the person themselves.

        As you can probably tell from reading this, I have re-written this many times, truthfully while I can point to a couple of reasons as to why I might create this blog, but they're not really <b>the</b> reason, and to be honest that's because that reason just doesn't exist.
        
        I was going to write something here about that, about not being able to justify this blogs creation.
        But I can't.
        So I hope you enjoy your time here.
        And if I know you personally, Thank you, I couldn't mean that more sinscerely than I do.
