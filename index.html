            <p>This is a blog run by me, here I write about a variety of topics and my opinions on them. This is largely a passion project and therefore like many of my other projects I will likely give up on it after a while. Thanks for visiting, and I hope you enjoy your stay. : )â€ƒ- Peter</p>

            <p>A small note on the styling of this site, the style of this site will change and update just like the blogs, im still learning CSS. also if you're on mobile forgive the weird styling, i try and keep up but trying to keep up with how changes affect different devices is difficult.</p>
