        <h2>Dark Side Of The Moon</h2>
        <p>It has allmost become a Cliche to talk about dark side of the moon, probably one of the most well known albums of all time its album art alone one of the most recognisable in history; and yet somehow this album still manages to envoke feelings of awe in me. Through all its fame it cuts through years of musical innovation and to this day provides an overwhelming originality, its one of those albums that i kind of feel provides a root for the appreciation of the intricacies of music as a genuine art form. Fuck i sound pretencious here dont I? 
          
          i just kinda love this album and think that everyone should listen to it kind of irrespective on their opinions of music
        
          and to hell with it, if you hate it you hate it. but you cant hate what you dont try.
